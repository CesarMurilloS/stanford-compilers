Stanford compilers course
=========================

This repository has my solutions to the 4 course assignments (one directory to each assignment), the goal of which is to build a compiler that compiles the COOL programming language to MIPS assembly code.

Building the various stages of the compiler is somewhat involved, please see the README files in each of the subdirectories.
